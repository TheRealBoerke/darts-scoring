# Darts Scoring

Darts Scoring is a simple tool, written in Python to simulate or even keep track of darts games. The tool is modular in nature, in the sense that each game is its own class.

This project is part of the Python back-end course path at [boot.dev](https://boot.dev), specifically the First personal project set of sessions.

Currently supported games:
* x01 (301, 501, 701, etc.)
* tactics
